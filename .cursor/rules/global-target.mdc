# OpenManus Global Mission and Objectives

## Ultimate Vision
To create an AI-powered system built on OpenManus that can simulate and replace traditional software company functions, delivering production-grade software systems through automated requirements analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Project Phases

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis Assistant
STATUS: In Progress
FOCUS: Development of an intelligent requirements analysis system

#### Phase 1 Success Criteria
1. Requirements Capture
   - MUST accurately extract requirements from user input
   - MUST maintain requirement consistency
   - MUST detect requirement conflicts
   - MUST suggest requirement refinements

2. Requirements Analysis
   - MUST perform feasibility analysis
   - MUST identify technical constraints
   - MUST estimate implementation complexity
   - MUST suggest architectural approaches

3. Requirements Documentation
   - MUST generate structured requirement documents
   - MUST maintain requirement traceability
   - MUST support version control
   - MUST enable collaborative review

4. Quality Metrics
   - MUST achieve >95% requirement clarity
   - MUST maintain <2% requirement conflicts
   - MUST complete analysis within defined timeframes
   - MUST generate actionable technical specifications

### Future Phases (Planned)

#### Phase 2: Design Assistant
- System architecture design
- Component specification
- Interface definition
- Technology stack selection

#### Phase 3: Development Assistant
- Code generation
- Test case creation
- Code review
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Testing Assistant
- Test strategy development
- Automated testing
- Bug detection and analysis
- Quality assurance

#### Phase 5: Deployment Assistant
- Deployment planning
- Infrastructure setup
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and maintenance
