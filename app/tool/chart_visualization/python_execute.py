1. The code should generate a comprehensive text-based report containing dataset overview, column details, basic statistics, derived metrics, timeseries comparisons, outliers, and key insights.
2. Use print() for all outputs so the analysis (including sections like 'Dataset Overview' or 'Preprocessing Results') is clearly visible and save it also
3. Save any report / processed files / each analysis result in worksapce directory: {directory}
4. Data reports need to be content-rich, including your overall analysis process and corresponding data visualization.
